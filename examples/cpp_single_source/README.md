# C++ Single Source

These are examples of C++ programs which contain code to interact with a CPU-side API, and also one or more GPU kernels.

- the CPU-side API is used to do things like:
    - allocate GPU memory
    - copy data from main memory into GPU memory
    - launch a kernel on the GPU
    - copy data back from GPU memory into main memory
- the kernels will run on the GPU cores

Currently, these examples are a 'stretch goal', a work in progress. Stay tuned :)
